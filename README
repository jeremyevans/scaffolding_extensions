ScaffoldingExtensions
=====================

The Scaffolding Extensions plugin enhances Rails' default scaffolding in the
following ways:

  * Choose which fields are displayed in the scaffolds and in which order
  * Handle belongs_to associations with select boxes or auto completing text
    boxes in the scaffolded forms
  * Handle has_and_belongs_to_many associations, with multiple methods (Ajax,
    select boxes, autocompleting text boxes)
  * Show associated objects on the show and edit scaffolds
  * Add links to associated objects on the edit scaffold for the model, 
    allowing fast access to manage associated models, edit the 
    has_and_belongs_to_many asociations, or add objects for has_many
    associations.
  * Add search scaffolding using any fields of the model, with a pagination of
    the results
  * Add scaffolding for merging records (combining two records into one by
    updating all associations)
  * Show associated data instead of the foreign key integer in show/search
    results scaffold
  * Specify the visible names for column headers and form labels
  * Choose which methods are added by the scaffold function
  * Many customization options for all parts of scaffolding

Please note that this does not affect the scaffold generator (script/generate
scaffold). This plugin only affects the scaffold method.  It is designed to
replace the generator by being customizable enough so that you would not need
to modify its output.  However, there is support for outputing the controller
code generated by the scaffold method (see below).

This plugin should be compatible with Rails 1.2. Older versions are 
compatible with Rails 1.1.x (svn revision 61), but the current version is
not. It is not tested on Edge Rails, it always targets the latest stable 
Rails version.

Quick Start
===========

In an existing Rails application, create a controller
(i.e. "script/generate controller crud"), and modify so it looks like:

  class CrudController < ApplicationController
    scaffold_all_models
  end

Then go to the index page for the controller (e.g. http://website/crud).  
You'll see a link to a management page for each of your models.  Each
management page has links to create, delete, edit, show, search, and merge
pages for the model. The pages should be usable right away, but you'll want to
add some configuration code to your models to specify the default names to
display in select boxes, attributes to show on the forms, associations to show,
whether to use select boxes or autocompleting text boxes, etc..

Backwards Compatibility Note
============================

Recent versions of the plugin are more strict than previous versions in the 
arguments to scaffold and scaffold_habtm. Originally I thought that using 
singularize on an already singular word (or pluralize on an already plural
word) would have no effect (like using camelize on an already camelized word).
However, this isn't the case and can cause bugs for some common words (notably
things ending in "ss"), so now you must you the singular, underscored, form:

  scaffold :artist # Works
  scaffold :albums # Doesn't work

  scaffold :album, :habtm=>:artist # Yes
  scaffold :artist, :habtm=>albums # No

  scaffold_habtm :album, :artist # Dice
  scaffold_habtm :albums, :artists # No Dice
  scaffold_habtm :album, :artists # Still No Dice
                                               
I chose to use the singular form even for the habtm forms as that is the one
the documentation has always used. Note that if you just use
scaffold_all_models, you don't need to worry about this.

Customization
=============

An addition to the new scaffold features that this plugin adds (merge, search,
belongs_to, and habtm scaffolding), the major attraction of this plugin is the
ability to customize the scaffolding by adding some code to the model class.
Let's start with the most common customizations:

  class Album < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_and_belongs_to_many :artists
    belongs_to :genre
    @scaffold_fields = %w'name rating genre numtracks'
    @scaffold_select_order = 'name'
    @scaffold_column_names = {:numtracks=>'Number of Tracks'}
    @scaffold_auto_complete_options = {}
    def scaffold_name
      name[0...50]
    end
  end

@scaffold_fields determines which fields are shown in the new, edit, and search
forms (which use the order specified).  It defaults to content_columns plus
belongs_to associations. @scaffold_select_order determines which order is used
in the SQL ORDER clause when displaying a list of albums (for example, from the
edit link of the management page).  @scaffold_column_names specifies the 
visible names for each attribute.  @scaffold_auto_complete_options turns on
autocompleting for the model, instead of using select boxes (necessary for a
decent response time if you have a large number of records).   scaffold_name
determines the name to use for each album inside those select boxes.  Note that
it is a method and not a variable, so you need to specify a ruby instance
method for it.

Notice in this case that genre was specified.  In this case, our schema has 
genre_id as a foreign key to the genres table.  If you specified genre_id,
you'd get a usual text input box for the foreign key integer.  If you specify
genre (the name of the belongs_to association), instead of a text input box,
you will get a select box with all genres, allowing you to pick one.  It will
use the @scaffold_select_order variable and scaffold_name method in the Genre 
model to format the select box.  If you have @scaffold_auto_complete_options
set in the Genre model, there will be an autocompleting text box instead of a
select box (though since there aren't that many genres, you would probably be
better off with a select box in this case).

There are also a couple of customizations that can be set in the controller:

  * @scaffold_template_dir => Allows you to choose a separate directory for the
    scaffolds (instead of the one that comes with this plugin)
  * @default_scaffold_methods => Allows you to change the methods scaffolded by
    default, instead of using :except or :only each time.

There are some other lessor used options which allow you to:

  * Set the css class of scaffolded tables per ActiveRecord class
  * Override the input widget type and widget options per attribute
  * Choose which associations to display on the edit screen of a model
  * Choose which associations to eagerly load when displaying select boxes for
    the model
  * Set the number of records returned in searching or browsing
  * Specify different fields used in each type of scaffold (e.g. certain fields
    can only be viewed, not edited)

Consult the RDoc if you would like more information on these (and other
options).

General Usage
=============

In many cases, if you are just using the plugin to create an easy
administrative front end to your existing application, it will probably be
easier to use scaffold_all_models instead of following the instructions below,
as that takes care of things for you.  The instructions below predate the
introduction of scaffold_all_models, and show how different options passed to
the scaffold method affect the creation of the scaffolding.  They will mainly
be useful if you are using the scaffolding for non administrative forms.

Generally, the scaffolding extensions are used in same way as the normal
scaffolding.  Inside a controller, add:

  scaffold :album
  
In addition to the normal options, this plugin adds the following options to
the scaffold method:

  * :except => don't generate methods for certain actions
  * :only => only generate methods for given actions
  * :habtm => generate a has_and_belongs_to_many scaffold for the given classes
  * :generate => return the code generated instead of evaluating it

So these is are valid calls to scaffold:

  scaffold :album, :suffix=>true, :except=>:delete, :habtm=>[:artist]
  scaffold :artist, :only=>[:new, :edit, :search, :manage], :habtm=>:album

Let's say you just do the simplest possible command (scaffold :album).  Then
you go to the index of the controller.  You'll notice some differences.  The
default Rails scaffold page has a paginated table of records.  This plugin
changes that to a simple management page with the following links:

  * Browse albums
  * Create album
  * Destroy album
  * Edit album
  * Merge albums
  * Search albums
  * Show album

Clicking on show, destroy, or edit links will bring up a simple select box
allowing you to choose a record to show, destroy, or edit.  Clicking on new
will bring you to a form that allows you to create a new object (similar to the
default form, with slightly different formatting).  Clicking on search will
bring up a simple search form for searching on any of the fields in the new or
edit form (the search results page looks similar to the default Rails list
page).  Clicking on merge will bring up a page with two select boxes, allowing
you to merge two records of the same type (by updating the necessary
associations and then deleting the record to be merged).  Clicking on browse
brings up a paginated table of records similar to the search results.

If you specified any actions in :except (or didn't include them in :only),
the appropriate links won't appear in the management page.  If you specified
:manage in :except, the management page won't be created.  The scaffold methods
that are available for use in :except and :only are:

  [:manage, :show, :destroy, :edit, :new, :search, :merge, :browse]
  
Let's say you used the command:

  scaffold :artist, :only=>[:new, :edit, :search, :manage], :habtm=>:album

The manage page would look like:

  * Create album
  * Edit album
  * Search albums

If you click on the edit albums link and select an album, you'll notice that
below the entry form for updating the album are all of the items associated
with the current item (unless you overrode it using the
@scaffolded_associations variable in the model).  Assuming you use 
:suffix=>true when creating scaffolds and create scaffolds for multiple models
in the same controller, the associated items will be linked so that they can be
easily edited.

If you just want to create habtm scaffolds, there is a command that does so:

  scaffold_habtm(:artist, :album)

By default, this will create the habtm scaffold both ways. You can go to
edit_album_artists/42 to edit the artists for album 42 and
edit_artist_albums/42 to edit the albums for artist 42.

Testing
=======

The plugin now includes functions that make it easier to test.  The testing 
isn't comprehensive, as it doesn't test if the forms work, it just tests to see
if you can successfully request the displayed pages.  Still, it is useful to
see if any errors are produced due to naming conflicts (which can be resolved
by adding some configuration code to the model or changing the arguments to the
scaffold method call). For example:

  class CrudControllerTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
    def setup
      @controller = CrudController.new
      @request    = ActionController::TestRequest.new
      @response   = ActionController::TestResponse.new
   end
    test_scaffold_all_models
    # or test_scaffold :album
  end

Consult the RDoc if you want view more testing options.

Code Generation
===============

I don't recommend using the generated code for anything more than debugging,
but if you want to see the code that is generated, try this for a single model:

  script/runner "puts ActionController::Base.scaffold(:model, \
                 :generate=>true)"

or this for all models:

  script/runner "puts ActionController::Base.scaffold_all_models( \
                 :generate=>true)}"
